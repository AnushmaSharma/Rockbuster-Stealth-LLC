# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Project Summary
The Rockbuster Stealth LLC Online Expansion Analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to help Rockbuster, a former leader in physical movie rentals, transition to an online rental platform. Facing competition from major streaming services, Rockbusterâ€™s goal is to leverage existing data to optimize content offerings, pricing strategies, and target specific markets to drive engagement and revenue growth.

## Key Questions

1. Which customer segments should Rockbuster target for retention and growth?
2. How can Rockbuster optimize rental pricing and durations?
3. What regions offer the highest potential for expanding the customer base and revenue?
4. Which countries and cities have the most customers?
5. What movies and genres generate the most revenue?

## Data & Tools Used
The analysis was conducted using Rockbuster's relational database management system, powered by PostgreSQL. The dataset provides comprehensive information on Rockbuster's operations, including film inventory, customer demographics, payment transactions, store locations, staff details, film information, actor profiles, rental history, and customer addresses. Data handling and SQL queries were performed using pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL, while Tableau Public was utilized for visualizing key insights and trends.
